This repository contains an Object Detection project using OpenCV and deep learning frameworks. The model detects and classifies objects in images and videos using pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Haar Cascades. It provides real-time detection capabilities with optimized performance.

Features:

Object detection using OpenCV and deep learning
Pre-trained models
Real-time detection using webcam or video files
Custom model training and fine-tuning
Bounding box visualization with labels and confidence scores
Performance evaluation with accuracy metrics
